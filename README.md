# unit-4-game

This game is all about mathematics.

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. 

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. The value of each crystal will be hidden from you until you click on it.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

Each time the game starts, the value of each crystal will change.
